Server Outline with coordinator

1. create one hub and two servers 

1.1 server init connect to hub or to designated server

1.1.1 servers need ingress and egress

1.1.2 need routing table from connect hub or server to fully connect

1.2 hub init - connects to one server

1.3 created a sorted descending routing table based on latency

1.3.1 hub pings servers to see how long end-to-end latency

1.3.2 pings is timing UDP to time -> send null -> server responses -> sends hub -> recieve - > time

1.3.2.1 end time - start time = latency - do it three times for average

1.3.2.2 TODO: test bandwidth with larger volume

1.3.3 redo pinging and routing table every 15 minutes?

1.4 create HashMap of files to master servers to duplicate servers

1.4.1 duplicate servers are servers in a wide range of pings from the routing table

2. hub receives a client message

example:

RITE"Student:{
  name:Bob
  age: 21
}"

3. hub sends client message and duplicate servers to the master server (the coordinator)

3.1 the master server is the first row of the routing table

4. master server receives information

4.1 parses first four bytes to see which function to use

5. EXAMPLE with write

5.1 parse RITE

5.2 create new text file with JSON names and file in with JSON body

5.3 tcp connection with duplicate servers

5.4 send write messages to duplicate servers

5.4.1 need to overload write message with and without list of duplicate servers

6. EXAMPLE with READ (does not need to be master server, hub should connect with the closest ping)

6.1 parse READ and other information

6.1.1 other information include JSON name and keys fo values wanted from object

6.2 find text file with matching JSON name

6.3 Parse JSON object for key's values

6.4 return values
